Introduction to Automation:
    what is automation?
	    -> Process of converting Manual test cases into automation with script using automation
 tool with programmin or scripting(js) language.
 
 D/b pragramming & scripting:
  Program:    									scripting
     ->used to build full            ->used to automate tasks or enhance         
       fledged apps(eg.java			   existing applications (eg., js
	   for android apps)			   for web pages.
	   
Advantages of automation:
  -> avoid repetitive tasks 
  ->reusability of code
  ->Accuracty in results
  ->Improved quality of software
  
 when we will go for automation:
   ->Long term project.
   ->when more regression cycles are available.
   ->when more repetitive task need to do
   ->when manual test case document is ready.
  
 what is not automatable?
   1.Audio & video related Test cases.
   2.OTP, 3.captcha, 4.Iam not a robot, 5.fingerprints, 6.printer, 7.Barcode,
   8.Face recognition, 9.Embedded Related Test Cases.(hardware+software)
   
Types of automation Tools:
  1.Functional   2.Non-Function automation tools
       
1.Functional automation tool:
       ->These tools tests the functionality fo an application to ensure it behaves as expected
	   ->purpose: automate UI,API, business logic validation.
	   ->focus:verifies software meets requirements
	   
	   example scenarios:
	   -> clicking buttons,filling forms,verifying output
	   -> login functionality,payment processing etc.,
	   
	   Tools:
	   1.Selenium: automates web applications(browser-based testing)
	   2.TestNG: Java testing framework for functional testing.
	   3.Cypress: modern javascript based web testing tool.
	   4.Appium: Mobile app automation(ios & android).
	   5.Postman: API functional testing.
	   6.Katalon studio: All in one testing tool for(web,API,mobile).
	   
2.Non-Functional automation tool:
